# Audio Player App

This Flutter app demonstrates creating custom widgets.
(Audio Player with Custom Widget)

## Creating Custom Widget

We are going to use simple basic widgets to create a custom widget. This is called **composition** 
We can create a package of this & reuse this custom widget in any project that we want.

The widget that we have in this project is as shown below:
![Custom Widget](https://github.com/annapurna23/audio_player/blob/main/screenshots/custom-widget.jpeg?raw=true)
1. Container: all the simple widgets will be inside a container
2. Icon: play/pause button
3. Text: current time of the track
4. Slider: the audio track bar 
5. Text: the total time of the track
6. Row: all the widgets are inside a row widget.

You can checkout the app face from the [screenshot here](https://github.com/annapurna23/audio_player/blob/main/screenshots/app-image.png).
